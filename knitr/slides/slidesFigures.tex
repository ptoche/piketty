%%%%%%%%%% Define ggplot_dual_axis() function %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function takes two ggplot objects, takes one grid and switches the axis
% This function has problems: the rhs axis grid overwrites the data and legend
% To do: lhs grid with invisible data + rhs grid with invisible data + data grid
% Figures 9.1, 12.1, 12.2 are therefore suboptimal.
