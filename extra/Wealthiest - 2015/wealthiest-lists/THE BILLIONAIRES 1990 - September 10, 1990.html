                (FORTUNE Magazine) &ndash; SULTAN HAJI HASSANAL BOLKIAH MU'IZZADIN WADDAULAH,44 Bandar Seri Begawan BRUNEI $25.0B Oil and gas resources; real estate around the world; foreign
                investments. The tiny sultanate of Brunei (pop. 227,000) on the northwest coast of Borneo is one of the world's oldest extant monarchies. Bolkiah, Sultan No. 29, has two wives -- one
                the Queen of Brunei, the other a former airline stewardess -- with whom he alternates nights. The Sultan may have been embarrassed by press reports about a $70 million marijuana
                operation that authorities recently uncovered on his cattle station near Katharine, Australia. Eight people were arrested.

                KING FAHD BIN ABDUL-AZIZ AL SAUD, 69 and family Riyadh SAUDI ARABIA $18.0B Saudi Arabia's oil and gas resources. Of the plentiful progeny of King Abdul- Aziz, also known as Ibn Saud,
                founder of modern Saudi Arabia, Fahd and his six full brothers are regarded as among the best educated and most able. This is fortunate for his country because a confrontation looms
                between Fahd and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who threatens the desert kingdom.

                Mars Inc.: M&amp;M/Mars, Uncle Ben's Rice, Kal-Kan pet food, Mars Electronics. Forrest Sr. ceded nominal control of Mars Inc. to his sons, John and Forrest Jr., in 1973 and later took
                up residence over his Las Vegas candy factory. Alas, the two boys have not equaled the sum of one old man, and competitors such as Hershey and Nestle now threaten Mars's primacy in
                the ''chocolate-enrobed'' products arena -- a.k.a. candy bars. As always, + family and company are circumspect about publicity. They allegedly have nixed advertisements on such TV
                shows as Nightline and Golden Girls, which they deem symbolic of ''antifamily, antireligious, or antisocial behavior.''

              <p xmlns="">
                QUEEN ELIZABETH II, 64 London ENGLAND $11.7B The Crown Estates: 267,000 acres in England and Scotland; U.S. and European real estate; racehorses; art, stamp, silver, porcelain, and
                jewelry collections; vast stock portfolio. As long as the monarch's personal fortune remains untaxed, Elizabeth II will remain the world's richest woman. And she's only getting
                richer. Her net worth has increased by around $800 million this year: Analysts estimate her stock portfolio has risen a stately 8% since last year, and her art collection is up some
                40% in value.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                SAMUEL I. NEWHOUSE JR., 62 DONALD E. NEWHOUSE, 60 and family New York NEW YORK $11.5B 100% of Advance Publications and Newhouse Broadcasting. Si and Don have been running Advance,
                which includes Conde Nast's Vogue and Vanity Fair along with 30 newspapers and several radio stations, for 11 years now since their dad, Sam Newhouse, died. Early this year, the
                family finally won its tax bout with the IRS over Sam's estate. The feds had sought $610 million in inheritance taxes, but Si and Don will have to fork over a fraction of that.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                ALBERT REICHMANN, 62 PAUL REICHMANN, 61 RALPH REICHMANN, 58 Toronto CANADA $11.1B 100% of Olympia &amp; York Developments. The Reichmann family is as secretive as it is wealthy, and
                with an $11 billion nest egg, up from $8.4 billion last year, they are very wealthy. But they lent money to the ill-fated Robert Campeau, and the bankruptcy of his Allied-Federated
                Stores splashed some unwelcome ink on the Reichmanns anyway.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                YOSHIAKI TSUTSUMI, 56 Tokyo JAPAN $7.3B 40% of Kokudo Keikaku, which owns 48.5% of land-rich Seibu Railway. Would that Japan's richest man were also its best loved. But Yoshiaki
                Tsutsumi isn't winning any popularity contests. After nearly a year as head of Japan's Olympic Committee, he resigned, criticized for mishaps at the Asian Winter Games and for his
                efforts to lure the 1998 Winter Olympics to a spot near one of his resorts.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                SAM MOORE WALTON, 72 and family Bentonville ARKANSAS $7.3B 38.5% of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Some 1,438 Wal-Marts dot the South and Midwest ) like freckles on a Norman Rockwell urchin. As
                solidly patriotic as any of that painter's subjects, Wal-Mart initiated the Buy American program in 1985 to help keep the country competitive. With earnings of $1.1 billion on sales
                over $25 billion, the retailer is certainly doing its part. No wonder it consistently ranks as the most admired retailer in the U.S.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                JOHN WERNER KLUGE, 75 Charlottesville VIRGINIA $7.0B 97.4% of Metromedia Inc.; real estate; stockholdings; cash, lots of it. Starting with a small radio concern that he took over in
                1959, Kluge built a cornucopian media company whose properties included cellular telephones and the Harlem Globetrotters. He sold it in 1984 and started all over again with a ''new''
                Metromedia that has a hand in everything from steakhouses to robotic billboard painting. The German-born billionaire is starting over in his personal life too, having ended his
                nine-year marriage to Patricia Rose, a Junoesque armful who once took it all off for a British skin magazine. Now she takes title to their 45-room Charlottesville mansion plus 9.9
                acres.

              <p xmlns="">
                TSAI WAN-LIN, 65 TSAI WAN-TSAI, 61 and family Taipei TAIWAN $6.5B 65% of Cathay Life Insurance; 60% of Cathay Construction. A plunging Taiwan stock market has clipped nearly a third
                off the Tsais' fortune since last year. But they'll never have to go back to the fruit and vegetable stand that launched their careers as billionaires. Later, they branched out into
                soy sauce and eventually into a wide range of financial and industrial concerns. Today, Cathay is the largest privately owned construction outfit in Taiwan.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KENNETH ROY THOMSON, 67 and family Toronto CANADA $6.2B 69.2% of Thomson Corp.; 78.5% of Hudson's Bay Co.; 12.4% of Consolidated Talcorp; art; real estate. Thomson, the Right
                Honorable Lord of Fleet -- as in Fleet Street -- controls nearly 600 daily and weekly newspapers throughout North America and Britain. They might just as well use their presses to
                print money: The company earns an estimated $1.5 million each day. The frugal Thomson spends very little of those millions on such fripperies as clothing, continuing to wear a
                weathered gray overcoat and carry a plastic shopping bag as a briefcase. He and his wife, Marilyn, have three children.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KICHINOSUKE SASAKI, 58 Tokyo JAPAN $5.7B 100% of Togensha, a real estate firm. Sasaki professes, ''The best way to travel is to go on the spur of the moment, tripping around like some
                vagabond.'' Indeed, the real estate mogul's career has been peripatetic. Sasaki started out in law school, switched to medicine, and eventually went into commercial real estate in
                Tokyo after opening a couple of clinics. He lives modestly on the credo that ''You can't have as much as you want because it's not good for you.''
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                GERALD GROSVENOR, 38 and family London ENGLAND $5.4B Real estate holdings including 300 acres in London's exclusive Mayfair and Belgravia districts, 100,000 acres of Scottish
                woodlands, 12,000 acres in Vancouver, British Columbia, a 10,000-acre Australian sheep station, commercial properties in Britain, Hawaii, and California, and holdings in Northern
                Ireland. Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of Westminster, is Britain's wealthiest man and second-largest landowner after the Queen. Although Grosvenor's properties, which he inherited and
                enhanced through shrewd business dealings, earn him an estimated $5,100 an hour, a revision in British tax law allows him to pay his taxes at the same rate as his housekeeper and

                winning (though at great cost) a war for Italy's biggest publisher, Mondadori. He is battling media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, and the smart money backs De Benedetti for the long
                haul.

                PHILIP FREDERICK ANSCHUTZ, 50 Denver COLORADO $1.1B 100% of Anschutz Corp.: Southern Pacific Railroad and Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, oil, real estate, ranching, and
                cement. Valuable, undeveloped land near downtown Denver and key national rail links with their associated real estate all contribute to Anschutz's standing as Colorado's richest man.
                His 1988 purchase of Southern Pacific was so highly leveraged that Anschutz sold off railroad land to keep the banks and bondholders at bay.

                the shop for half a century, company founder and patriarch Sebastiao Camargo stepped down last year, ceding control to longtime employee Werner Schmidt Rehder. Rehder's appointment
                surprised some, notably Sebastiao's son-in-law, Carlos Dias, whom some thought likely to take the top spot. But sources say the new Camargo president possesses in abundance that one
                quality Sebastiao finds irresistible: discretion.

              <p xmlns="">
                Estimates of net worth are based on published information or appraisals of asset values. To qualify, a prospect must have a net worth -- total assets after subtracting debt -- of $1
                billion or more. For those with holdings in publicly traded companies, the value of their shares was computed using the closing price on July 16. Currency conversions into U.S.
                dollars were based on July 16 exchange rates. To determine the value of holdings in private companies, Fortune identified similar public companies, made reasonable adjustments for
                dissimilarities, and calculated a value based on the current market value of the public counterparts. In some cases we used prices paid for similar companies in recent takeovers or
                buyouts. Where data are lacking for ownership of shares in private companies, we used the best information available from persons knowledgeable about the companies and individuals
                involved. The list includes individuals or a ''nuclear'' family composed of husband and wife, parent and child, siblings, or some combination of those relationships. We exclude
                cousins and in-laws, though when brothers and their children are involved in a business, the cousins obviously have a stake in a single fortune. Where it is clearly documented that
                family members share in the single fortune, we list them by name; where ownership boundaries are unclear, we note ''and family.'' When the wealth is explicitly concentrated in the
                hands of one individual, we list him or her alone. We are indebted to our correspondents. Sources outside the Time and Fortune network: Japan -- Nikkei Venture magazine; Switzerland
