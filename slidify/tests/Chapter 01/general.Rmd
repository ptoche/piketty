### Question 11

Explain the difference between Gross Domestic Product and Net National Product. How large can the difference be? Illustrate with examples.

*** .hint
Explain the difference between Gross and Net, and between Domestic and National.

*** .explanation
There are 2 main adjustments. To go from Gross to Net, deduct the depreciation of the capital stock (analogous to a 'disinvestment'). To go from Domestic to National, deduct incomes paid to foreign residents (e.g. payments to foreign consultants) and add incomes from paid to national residents from abroad (e.g. local resident earning rental payments on a house owned in a foreign country). The first adjustment results in the Net product being about 10% smaller than the Gross product. The second adjustment typically results in a 1-2% adjustment, except in countries with very large balance of payments imbalances, e.g. Ireland, Philippines. In Ireland, foreign investments are high, owing to favourable taxation, and receive a very high share of corporate profit. In the Philippines, many nationals work abroad (3.5 milion work in the United States, 1.3 million work in Saudi Arabia, 1 million in the United Arab Emirates) and repatriate their saving.
