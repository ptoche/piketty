    <h3>Capital and Labor in the Long Run</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The nature of capital has transformed over time, from land and real estate in the 18th century to industrial and financial capital in the 21st.</li>
<li>The rise of &#39;human capital&#39; suggests that labor should claim a growing share of national income. But the data does not bear this out.</li>
<li>The rise of private capital in recent years is primarily due to a slowdown of population growth and productivity growth, together with political stability, property rights and tax policies that favor private capital.</li>
<li>One measure of the evolution of the capital-labor split (the relative income shares) is the capital/income ratio (the ratio of the total stock of capital to the annual flow of income).</li>
<li>Let&#39;s clarify the meaning of income, capital, and wealth.</li>

    <h3>The Concept of National Income</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><em>National income</em> is closely related to <em>Gross Domestic Product</em> (GDP).</li>
<li>GDP measures the market value of all goods and services produced in a given year within the borders of a given country. </li>
<li>This excludes last year&#39;s goods, non-market goods, wealth, natural resources, truth and beauty. The treatment of housing services is special.</li>
<li><p>There are two important differences between GDP and national income. </p>

<p><code>1</code>. Deduct the depreciation of the capital stock. </p>

<p><code>2</code>. Add income received from abroad and subtract income paid to non-residents. </p></li>

    <h3>The Concept of National Income</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p><code>1</code>. Deduct the depreciation of the capital stock</p>

<ul>
<li>To compute national income we deduct wear and tear on buildings, infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, computers, and other items.</li>
<li>Different capital goods depreciate at different rates. The average depreciation is about 10 percent of GDP in most countries. </li>
<li>Just as investment adds to the capital stock, depreciation subtracts &mdash; investment is priced by the market, depreciation by accountants. </li>
<li><p>To see why deducting depreciation makes sense, think of it as a &#39;disinvestment&#39; caused by the act of production. </p></li>
<li><p>Investment includes &#39;fixed capital formation&#39;, residential construction and inventories. Depreciation is known as &#39;fixed capital consumption.&#39;</p></li>

    <h3>The Concept of National Income</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p><code>2</code>. Add income received from abroad and subtract income paid to foreigners. </p>

<ul>
<li>In the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, China, Brazil, Japan, national income is within 1 or 2 percent of domestic product. </li>
<li>In all these countries, the inflow of profits, interest, dividends, rent, and so on is approximately balanced by a comparable outflow. </li>
<li>In wealthy countries, net income from abroad is generally slightly positive.</li>
<li>Popular perception is very different &mdash; Europeans often incorrectly believe their capital is largely &#39;owned&#39; by the Japanese, Chinese, Saudis...</li>

    <h3>Related Income Concepts</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Related concepts are <em>Gross National Product</em> (GNP), <em>Gross National Income</em> (GNI), <em>Net Domestic Product</em> (NDP), <em>Net National Product</em> (NNP), and <em>Net National Income</em> (NNI). To see how they are related, contrast &#39;national&#39; with &#39;domestic&#39;; &#39;product&#39; with &#39;income&#39;; and &#39;gross&#39; with &#39;net&#39;.</li>
<li><strong>From GDP to GNP:</strong></li>
<li>While GDP measures output within the borders of a country, GNP measures output produced by citizens of the country, whether it is produced within or outside of the country. </li>
<li>To obtain GNP from GDP, add income earned abroad by residents and subtract income earned at home by non-residents. </li>
<li>In a country where firms are owned by foreigners, GDP may be greater than GNP. In a country where many citizens work abroad, the opposite.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Related Income Concepts</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In common parlance, &#39;income&#39;, &#39;product&#39;, &#39;output&#39;, &#39;revenue&#39;, &#39;expenditure&#39; are often used interchangeably. In national accounting, not so.</li>
<li><strong>From GDP to NDP:</strong></li>
<li>To obtain NDP from GDP, subtract capital depreciation. </li>
<li>National Income (NI) is short for Net National Product (NNP).</li>
<li><strong>From GDP to NNP:</strong></li>
<li>To obtain NI (=NNP) from GDP, apply both adjustments: add net income from abroad and subtract depreciation.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Related Income Concepts</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>When economists refer to a country&#39;s &#39;output&#39;, &#39;income&#39;, or &#39;production&#39;, they usually refer to real GDP (GDP adjusted for inflation). </li>
<li>When they refer to &#39;average income&#39; they usually refer to GDP per capita (= per head = per person).</li>
<li>When they compare countries, economists either convert at current market exchange rates or at Purchasing Power Parity rates (PPP).</li>
<li>When Piketty refers to &#39;national income&#39;, he refers to <em>Real Net National Product</em> and compares countries on a <em>PPP</em> basis.</li>
<li>When he refers to economic growth, he refers to the growth rate of real net national product. Because depreciation and inflation are deducted, this growth rate is smaller than that usually reported in the media.</li>
<li>This has confused some early, hasty readers of the book.</li>

    <h3>Global Income Identities</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>A country&#39;s national income may be greater or smaller than its domestic product, depending on whether net income from abroad is positive or negative:</p>

<p><strong>National Income = Domestic Output + Net Foreign Income</strong></p></li>
<li><p>At the global level, income received from abroad and paid abroad must balance:</p>

<p><strong>Global Income = Global Output</strong></p></li>
<li><p>National output and income can be decomposed as the sum of income to capital and income to labor:</p>

<p><strong>National Income = Capital Income + Labor Income</strong></p></li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li> Capital is defined as the sum of all non-human assets that can be owned and exchanged on some market, including:

<ul>
<li>all forms of real property (residential real estate);</li>
<li>financial assets (bank accounts, mutual funds, bonds, stocks, insurance policies, pension funds, net of debt);</li>
<li>business fixed investments (non-residential real estate, plants, infrastructure, machinery, patents) used by firms and government agencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Human Capital (an individual&#39;s labor power, skills, training, and abilities) is <strong><em>not</em></strong> included. Slaves are included.</li>
<li>Immaterial Capital (patents, other intellectual property) are included.</li>

    <h3>Capital and Wealth</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Economists usually call capital the forms of wealth accumulated by human beings (buildings, machinery, infrastructure) and exclude land and natural resources. Land is usually a component of wealth but not of capital.</li>
<li>But it is difficult to distinguish the value of buildings from the value of the land on which they are built.</li>
<li>Economists usually exclude residential real estate from capital because they consider it to be &#39;unproductive&#39; (&#39;productive capital&#39; includes industrial plants, office buildings, machinery).</li>
<li>Piketty includes both land and housing services, and uses the words &#39;capital&#39; and &#39;wealth&#39; interchangeably, as if they were perfectly synonymous. Get used to it.</li>

    <h3>Net Foreign Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Net Foreign Capital is the difference between assets owned by the country&#39;s citizens in the rest of the world and assets in the country owned by citizens of other countries. </p>

<p><strong>National Capital = Domestic Capital + Net Foreign Capital</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Economists usually use the term Net Foreign Assets (NFA).</p></li>
<li><p>In 1900 Britain and France both enjoyed significant net positive asset positions with the rest of the world. In 2010 many countries have approximately balanced net asset positions.</p></li>
<li><p>At the global level, all net positions must add up to zero.</p></li>

    <h3>The Capital/Income Ratio</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Income \(Y\) is a flow. It corresponds to the quantity of goods produced and distributed in a given period (one year).</li>
<li>Capital \(K\) is a stock. It corresponds to the total wealth owned at a given point in time. This stock comes from the wealth appropriated or accumulated in the past (several years).</li>
<li>The capital/income ratio is a stock divided by a flow:
\[
\beta = K/Y
\]</li>
<li>In the developed countries today, the capital/income ratio generally varies between 5 and 6. That&#39;s 5 and 6 years &mdash; or 500% and 600%.</li>
<li>The capital stock consists of two roughly equal shares: residential capital and professional capital used by firms and government. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Capital/Income Ratio</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In France and Britain, Germany and Italy, the United States and Japan, national income was roughly 30,000–35,000 euros per capita in 2010, while total private wealth (net of debt) was typically on the order of 150,000–200,000 euros per capita, or 5 to 6 times annual national income.</li>
<li>Each citizen of one of the wealthy countries owned approximately 90,000 euros in the form of housing and another 90,000 in stocks, bonds, savings, and other financial assets.</li>
<li>These average figures hide enormous disparities. </li>
<li>Income disparities are partly the result of unequal pay for work and partly of much larger inequalities in income from capital.</li>
<li>Much of the population has very little accumulated wealth.</li>

    <h3>The First Fundamental Law of Capitalism</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Piketty&#39;s &#39;first fundamental law of capitalism&#39; links the three most important concepts for understanding the capitalist system &mdash; the capital/income ratio, the rate of return on capital, and the share of capital in income:
\[
\alpha = r \times \beta
\]
where \(\alpha\) is the share of income from capital in national income and \(r\) the rate of return on capital. </li>
<li><strong>The &#39;first law&#39; is an accounting identity</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, if \(\beta = 600\%\) and \(r = 5\%\), then \(\alpha\) \(=\) \(r \times \beta\) \(=\) \(.05 \times 6\) \(=\) \(30\%\).</li>
<li>If national wealth is 600% of national income and the rate of return on capital 5% per year, then the capital income share <em>must be</em> 30%.</li>

    <h3>The First Fundamental Law of Capitalism</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In 2010 in wealthy countries capital income was about 30% of national income. With a capital/income ratio of about 600%, the rate of return on capital must have been around 5%.</li>
<li>Per capita national income is 30,000 euros per year, with 21,000 euros per year income from labor (70%) and 9,000 euros income from capital (30%). </li>
<li>Each citizen owns an average of 180,000 euros of capital, and the 9,000 euros of income from capital thus corresponds to an average annual return on capital of 5%.</li>

    <h3>The Rate of Return on Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The rate of return on capital measures the yield on capital over the course of a year regardless of its legal form (profits, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, capital gains), expressed as a percentage of the value of capital invested. It is therefore a broader notion than the &#39;rate of profit&#39;, and broader still than the &#39;rate of interest&#39;.</li>
<li>The rate of return can vary widely with the type of investment.</li>
<li>The average long-run rate of return on stocks is 7–8%; ot land in rural societies, about 4–5%; on real estate and bonds, about 3–4%; on public debt, it varies from country to country, with governments of wealthy countries usually paying low rates.<br></li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>From 1900 to 1980, 70–80% of the global production of goods and services was concentrated in Europe and America. By 2010, the European–American share had declined to roughly 50%, approximately the same level as in 1860. </li>
<li>It will probably continue to fall, perhaps to 20–30% in a few decades, a level consistent with the current population share.</li>
<li>The lead that Europe and America achieved during the Industrial Revolution allowed them to claim a share of global output 2 to 3 times greater than the world population share.</li>
<li>Many countries are now closing the gap.</li>

<li>Global inequality would be markedly higher if we used current exchange rates rather than purchasing power parities as above.</li>
<li>Consider the euro/dollar exchange rate. In 2012, a euro was worth about \$1.30 on the foreign exchange market. A European with an income of 1,000 euros per month could exchange that amount for \$1,300. If that person took that money to the United States the purchasing power would be \$1,300. </li>
<li>But European prices are about 10 percent higher than American prices, so that if the same money was spent in Europe, the purchasing power would be about \$1,170 instead of \$1,300. </li>
<li>Thus \$1.20 has &#39;purchasing power parity&#39; with 1 euro.</li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>An advantage of using purchasing power parities is that they are more stable than market exchange rates. </li>
<li>Exchange rates are extremely volatile. Exchange rates reflect not only the supply and demand for the goods and services of different countries, but also changes in the investment strategies of international investors, volatile estimates of the political and financial stability of the relevant countries, changes in monetary policy, trade policies, and so on. </li>
<li>The dollar/euro rate went from \$1.30 per euro in the 1990s to less than \$0.90 in 2001 before rising to around \$1.50 in 2008 and then falling back to \$1.30 in 2012, and to \$1.10 in 2015.</li>
<li>During that time, the PPP of the euro rose gently from about \$1 per euro in the early 1990s to \$1.20 in 2010.</li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In poorer countries, the corrections introduced by purchasing power parity are even larger: in Africa and Asia, prices are roughly half what they are in the rich countries, so that GDP roughly doubles when purchasing power parity is used instead of market exchange rates. </li>
<li>The main reason is that the prices of goods and services that cannot be traded internationally are lower, because they are usually relatively labor intensive and involve relatively unskilled labor (a relatively abundant factor of production in less developed countries).</li>
<li>In 2012, the correction coefficient was 1.6 in China and 2.5 in India.</li>

    <h3>What Forces Favor Convergence?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In theory, foreign ownership of capital can help convergence. </li>
<li>If rich countries have excess savings and capital and the &#39;marginal productivity of capital&#39; is very low, it can be efficient to invest in poorer countries abroad. </li>
<li>This way the wealthy investors obtain a higher return, while the influx of capital into poor countries raise their productivity, helping to close the gap between rich and poor. </li>
<li>In Africa, a substantial share of capital is owned by foreigners. The income of Africans is on average 5% less than the continent’s output. With a capital income share of 30%, this means that nearly 20% of African capital is owned by foreigners.</li>

    <h3>What Forces Favor Convergence?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The theory has two major problems: 
<code>1</code>. &#39;Factor Price Equalization&#39; is not sufficient for global convergence of per capita incomes.
<code>2</code>. A hypothetical convergence of output per capita does not imply convergence of income per capita. </li>
<li>Wealthy countries may continue to own large shares of the poor countries&#39; capital stocks indefinitely, so that the per capita national income of the wealthy countries remain permanently above poorer countries</li>
<li>The historical record suggests capital mobility has not been central to convergence. None of the Asian &#39;tigers&#39; has benefited from large foreign investments. These countries self-financed investments in physical capital and human capital. </li>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Historical experience suggests that the principal mechanism for convergence at the international as well as the domestic level is the diffusion of knowledge. </li>
<li>Knowledge diffusion depends on a country&#39;s ability to encourage large-scale investment in education and training of the population while guaranteeing stable property rights. </li>
<li>It is therefore closely associated with the achievement of legitimate and efficient government. </li>
<li>The diffusion of knowledge is often increased by international openness and trade. </li>
